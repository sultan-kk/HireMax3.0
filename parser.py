---------
Turns OCR line output (list of {"text", "confidence", "bbox"}) into:

    relevant   -> dict with keys: name, email, phone, skills,
                  experience_years, education
    irrelevant -> list of dicts: {"text", "confidence", "reason"}

Accuracy notes for this version (vs. the first release):
  1. SECTION-ZONE AWARENESS. Classification no longer looks at each line
     in isolation. It tracks which resume section it's currently inside
     (Hobbies / References / Personal Information / Education / ...) as
     it scans top to bottom, using config.SECTION_HEADERS. This fixes a
     real gap: a hobbies list like "- Cricket\n- Chess" under a "Hobbies:"
     header has NO hobby keyword on those lines themselves, so the old
     per-line-only keyword check let them slip into "relevant". Now every
     line inside a recognised noise section is classified by that
     section, not just lines that happen to repeat the section's keyword.
  2. PERSONAL/DEMOGRAPHIC FIELDS. CNIC, date of birth, marital status,
     nationality, religion, father's name, etc. are now their own
     "personal_info" category — routed to irrelevant instead of being
     left as unmapped noise. This also supports fairer/blinder initial
     screening, since these fields don't bear on qualification.
  3. SYMBOL-AWARE GARBAGE CHECK. The old alpha-ratio garbage filter
     mis-flagged legitimate skill lines like "C++, C#, ASP.NET" (lots of
     punctuation) as noise. Technical symbols common in skills (+ # . /
     &) are no longer counted against a line, and any line containing a
     known skill keyword is never flagged as garbage.
  4. PRECISE "CONSUMED LINE" TRACKING. Previously, "unmapped" leftover
     lines were computed with fuzzy substring matching against the
     extracted field VALUES — which broke silently whenever a value was
     reformatted (e.g. a phone number reformatted by `phonenumbers` no
     longer matches the raw OCR text), causing the source line to
     wrongly reappear as "unmapped". Extractors now return the exact
     source line INDEX they used, so consumption is tracked by identity,
     not string matching.

Design note for the FYP report: extraction is regex/keyword-driven by
default (fast, deterministic, easy to defend in a viva). If spaCy and
its English model are installed, name detection is upgraded to use
NER (PERSON entities) for better accuracy — but the app degrades
gracefully without it.
